        <strong>sahl</strong> is an ergonomic handler abstraction

        This page has its own URL (<code>/about</code>). Refreshing it still
        works because the filter returns <code>index.html</code> for any path
        that doesn't match a static asset, and React Router renders this
        component client-side.
      </p>
